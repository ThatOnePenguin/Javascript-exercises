 This first part is an example. The problem is listed below the example.

Example
The getDay() method returns the weekday as a number between   0 and 6.
(Sunday=0, Monday=1, Tuesday=2 ..)

This example uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:

switch (new Date().getDay()) {
  case 0:
         day = "Sunday";
         break;
  case 1:
         day = "Monday";
         break;
  case 2:
         day = "Tuesday";
         break;
  case 3:
         day = "Wednesday";
         break;
  case 4:
         day = "Thursday";
         break;
  case 5:
         day = "Friday";
         break;
  case 6:
         day = "Saturday";

         break;
 }   

The result of day will be:

Monday  


 The default keyword inside the switch specifies the code to run if there is no  case match: 

 default: 
         text = "Looking forward to the Weekend"; 


Problem
Finish the switch statement. Add the following cases: BMW, Ford and Peugeot. 
Set the value of the variable text to: "German car" for BMW. "American car" for Ford. "French car" for  Peugeot. 
Also add a default case where the text value is "Unknown car name". 



function checkCar() {
  var text;
  var favCar = prompt("input a car");

  switch(favCar) {
    case "BMW":
          car = 'German Car';
          break;
    case "Ford":
          car = 'American Car';
          break;
    case "Peugot":
          car = 'French Car';
          break;
    default:
          car = "Unkown car name";
          break;
  
  }
  return car
}

checkCar()
